# For this project I created a new table and imported the data about city bike lanes
*Next I explored the data using the following SQL

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.CityBikeLanes LIMIT 10;

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.CityBikeLanes WHERE street='Walnut';

/*CTE that list bike lanes with an average safety rating of 4.0 or higher as well as the average safety rating for each of those bike lanes*/
WITH street_avg_cte AS (
    SELECT street, AVG(safetyrating) rating
    FROM CityBikeLanes
    GROUP BY street
)

SELECT street, rating, 'safe lane' as 'label'
FROM street_avg_cte
WHERE rating>= 4.0;

/*Using a window function to partition the data by street and list the safety rating provided by both technicians as well as provide recommendations based on average safety rating*/
SELECT street, safetyrating, AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) as "Average_safety_rating",
CASE
WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) >= 4 THEN 'Leave As-Is'
WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) < 2.5 THEN 'Remove'
ELSE 'Improvements Needed'
END recommendation
FROM CityBikeLanes;
